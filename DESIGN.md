# Design

Living summary; details in `README.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Loop
Look into the four-room house, care for three dolls (tea, play, rest, reassure), fulfil daily wishes for buttons, decorate with six keepsakes, deepen closeness, perform three physical rituals (tea, sewing, moon chimes), follow three object stories, restore rooms, and greet the visitor after dark to collect six whispers and open the closed door. A four-minute day/night cycle drives atmosphere.

## Visual language
Soft porcelain and cream paper, rose, mint and gold accents, terracotta roof, warm interior light by day, cool moonlight with practical lamps at night. Serif display type for titles and story text, folded cream paper with a red-thread edge, restrained brass hairlines and a warm presentation plinth. Procedural meshes and canvas textures only.

## UI/UX principles
- One focal point: the house. A folded thread-paper clue and quiet material-led navigation edge support the miniature; expanded paper is optional.
- The top-left clue starts folded with one contextual action. Arrival names the actual object. A separate accessible fold control reveals the full clue; counters never wrap (`.wish-count` is nowrap).
- Bottom: named room tabs and a single quiet tools edge (discovery, House tools, sound, pause and home); thumb-reachable, at least 44px. Selection/carrying earns only the extra space it actually occupies.
- Ritual overlays hide the HUD they do not need and keep Exit, sound and pause visible.
- Room cameras fit measured visible controls. Tall width-bound phones place room detail lower; shorter phones regain scale. Whole-house reset and work cameras stay independent.
- Night changes palette, not layout. Reduced motion keeps pieces still.
- Phone landscape collapses room tabs into an icon grid; verify at 844x390.
- Check every change at 360x640, 390x844, 412x915, 844x390 in English and Arabic before shipping.

## Material sound, 2026-10-05
The existing mint-tin touch uses a short, quiet synthesized metal resonance; returning or replaying Noor's earned bear uses a soft filtered cloth rustle. These are successful-object responses, not a new reward or story loop. They remain silent until the player's sound gesture and respect pause, mute and disposal. Enamel/cloth mesh refinements remain deferred until rendered baseline and after-images can be reviewed.

## Stable selection, 2026-10-05
Direct scene selection keeps the camera and prop where the player touched. Measured HUD changes are cached during selection or a pointer gesture; explicit navigation and resize still use safe-area framing. On portrait phones, the selection ribbon uses the clearer measured edge and stays there throughout a carry, leaving the active scene target reachable. Discovery controls retain their explicit room-focus behavior. See the stable-scene-selection spec for native acceptance.

Short landscape uses the same target-aware paper placement. Upper side controls reserve space only where they overlap the ribbon horizontally; the top-center gap can keep whole-house props reachable. The paper is checked again against the final fitted projection after resize. Desktop placement is unchanged.
