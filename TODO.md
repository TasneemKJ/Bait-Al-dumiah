# TODO

## Done this iteration
- [x] play_check honours `PORT`; CI fast gate, failure-only trimmed artifacts, weekly full suite.
- [x] Objective step counter no longer wraps on narrow landscape cards (test: `tests/mobile-hud.test.mjs`).
- [x] Mobile home-screen check: no overflow, no sub-44px targets at 360x640, 390x844, 412x915, 844x390 (English).

## Open
- [ ] Arabic/RTL mobile screenshots and panels (household, journal, settings, night) reviewed.
- [ ] Portrait 390 camera crops the roof edges; consider a slightly wider framing.
- [ ] Explicit save schema version with tested migrations; export/import of the save.
- [ ] Open Graph/Twitter metadata and preview image from the real dollhouse; web manifest and icons.
- [ ] CREDITS.md (written), link from game settings and README.
- [ ] Performance budgets measured under 4x CPU throttle in the weekly suite.
- [ ] Move to current majors of GitHub Actions after checking latest release tags; Dependabot for npm, pip and actions.
- [ ] Tag `vX.Y.Z` after each merge.

## Brainstorm (iteration 2026-10-05, 20 ideas)
Chosen: nowrap counter (UI/UX, mobile), docs set (stability for later sessions). Others, not yet built: first-night greeting hint (onboarding), soft lullaby swell at dusk (audio), return-day greeting from dolls (retention), collection page for visitor gifts (replayability), save export (data safety), wider portrait framing (visuals), lower-poly fallback on weak phones (performance), larger text option (accessibility), gamepad rail for room tabs (controls), Levantine proverb on loading (writing), dust motes in sunbeams (atmosphere), tea steam particles (game feel), jasmine scent journal entry (authenticity), share card (release), error-boundary retry button (stability), nightly gift choice (loop), daily wish hint glow (self-teaching), pause-on-hidden toast (session), button-economy dashboard (balance), seed-varied dolls' wishes (replayability).

## Active atmosphere slice — 2026-10-05
- [x] Reproduce and fix inherited-key room lighting fallback (behavioral regression).
- [ ] Distinct mint enamel and woven bear finish, within existing story-art budget.
- [x] Material-specific, gesture-gated tin/cloth foley with source behavior tests.
- [ ] Brief bear cloth response; deferred with material visual changes until browser access works.
- [ ] Rendered desktop/phone, Arabic, reduced-motion and 4x CPU checks.
- [ ] Review actual screenshots and listen to foley before release; draft publication may record the blocker.
- [ ] Continue the unfinished forty-item roadmap in `docs/visual-40/2026-10-05-ultra-atmosphere.md`; numeric arrays do not count as passes.

Twenty ideas and IDEAL/5Ws for this slice are recorded in the iteration ledger. Selected: enamel, woven bear, bounded touch response, tin/cloth foley, matte pollen batching, safe lighting lookup. Other ideas remain deferred or preserved invariants.


## Reclaim the miniature — 2026-10-05
- [x] Inspect original baseline phone/desktop pixels and record twenty IDEAL/5Ws ideas in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-reclaim-the-miniature.md`.
- [x] Reproduce the wasted camera reservation and redundant arrival clue before source changes.
- [x] Fit focused rooms to the currently visible edge, preserving authored edge-prop bounds and independent ritual cameras.
- [x] Fold the contextual clue and replace stacked portrait capsules with a restrained two-row navigation edge; preserve 44px fallback targets.
- [x] Keep crowded selected-object feedback inside its existing ribbon, avoiding a second scene-covering card.
- [x] Add observer lifecycle, bilingual context and framing regressions plus real-DOM capture assertions.
- [ ] Run exact-commit real-DOM/full-game browser suites and inspect EN/AR day/night before/after originals, including 4× CPU and ritual returns. Visual acceptance remains pending.
- [ ] Review material/contact-depth refinements as a separate later art slice.

Selected ideas: camera composition, folded contextual guidance, material-led navigation and arrival self-teaching. The other sixteen ideas remain an explicit sequenced backlog in the spec; none is reported as implemented by this batch.

## Stable scene selection correction
- [x] Trace the native unchanged-coordinate second-touch miss and compare camera/paper alternatives.
- [x] Add failing projection/gesture regressions, preserve direct scene poses and cache pending insets.
- [x] Place portrait selection paper by measured clearance; classify top paper correctly and hold it during drag.
- [x] Add unchanged-position native touch checks and strengthen actual held destination checks in the full story journey.
- [ ] Verify exact corrected source through native same-position, bilingual short-phone and full physical journeys; inspect original images before merging.
