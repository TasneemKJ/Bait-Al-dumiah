# TODO

## Done this iteration
- [x] play_check honours `PORT`; CI fast gate, failure-only trimmed artifacts, weekly full suite.
- [x] Objective step counter no longer wraps on narrow landscape cards (test: `tests/mobile-hud.test.mjs`).
- [x] Mobile home-screen check: no overflow, no sub-44px targets at 360x640, 390x844, 412x915, 844x390 (English).

## Round 2 (2026-10-05)
Brainstorm, 20 ideas (IDEAL: problem, definition, options, act, look back; 5Ws: a phone player, mid-session, at the top HUD or on return, because clutter over the hero house and silent returns lose players):
1. Clue folds into a chip on phone portrait (UI/UX, visuals) - **shipped**
2. Whole house framed on 360-412 portrait (visuals, mobile) - **shipped**
3. Consistent HUD gutter in portrait and short landscape (UI/UX) - **shipped**
4. Welcome-back line naming what waits (retention, session design) - **shipped**
5. Save backup on unreadable/newer saves (data safety) - **shipped**
6. Save export/import (data safety, session design) - **shipped**
7. Mirror directional arrow in Arabic (Arabic/RTL) - **shipped**
8. Manifest, icons, share card from the real house (release readiness) - **shipped**
9. Privacy note and credits link in Settings (release readiness) - **shipped**
10. Measured phone performance budgets (performance) - **shipped** (script + weekly)
11. Unread-clue dot as a gentle first-five-minutes cue (onboarding) - **shipped**
12. Doll waves when a returning player opens the house (feel, retention) - later; needs acting work
13. Dusk music swell (audio) - **shipped**
12. Doll waves when a returning player opens the house (feel, retention) - **shipped** (reuses greeting pose)
13. Dusk music swell (audio) - later
14. Tea steam and dust motes (atmosphere) - owned by the atmosphere work in PR #20
15. Larger-text setting (accessibility) - **shipped (panels)**
16. Daily wish glow on the doll who wishes (self-teaching) - **shipped** (first three days)
17. Gift collection page for visitor gifts (replayability) - **shipped** (keepsake shelf with art)
18. Shami proverb on the loading card (writing, Levantine) - **shipped**
19. Minified three.js upgrade path (performance, upgrades) - later; #18 closed because 0.186 dropped .min builds
20. Low-detail auto fallback when frames drop (performance) - built on branch claude/game-audit-qa-batch9 (CPU-time governor, tested); NO PR until a real-device check shows benefit and the one-time shader-recompile hitch is acceptable (SwiftShader here cannot measure either)

## Open
- [ ] Arabic/RTL mobile screenshots and panels (household, journal, settings, night) reviewed.
- [ ] Absolute `og:image` URL once the production domain is recorded; artist icons and share card (ASSET_REQUESTS.md).
- [ ] Performance budgets measured under 4x CPU throttle in the weekly suite.
- [ ] Versions live in package.json and CHANGELOG (tags are not pushed: the proxy rejects them).

## Brainstorm (iteration 2026-10-05, 20 ideas)
Chosen: nowrap counter (UI/UX, mobile), docs set (stability for later sessions). Others, not yet built: first-night greeting hint (onboarding), soft lullaby swell at dusk (audio), return-day greeting from dolls (retention), collection page for visitor gifts (replayability), save export (data safety), wider portrait framing (visuals), lower-poly fallback on weak phones (performance), larger text option (accessibility), gamepad rail for room tabs (controls), Levantine proverb on loading (writing), dust motes in sunbeams (atmosphere), tea steam particles (game feel), jasmine scent journal entry (authenticity), share card (release), error-boundary retry button (stability), nightly gift choice (loop), daily wish hint glow (self-teaching), pause-on-hidden toast (session), button-economy dashboard (balance), seed-varied dolls' wishes (replayability).

## Brainstorm 3: visuals and atmosphere (2026-10-06)
Chosen: **golden hour at dusk** (shipped). Shortlist, not built: (a) soft lamp light pools on the floor at night, (b) warm window glow seen from outside as lit panes, (c) dust motes lit inside sunbeams near windows by day, (d) paper-grain material overlay on cards, (e) steam over the kettle in the kitchen when Lina is idle, (f) slow cloud shadows across the backdrop, (g) soft vignette that tightens at night, (h) curtain sway on the open window at dusk. Rejected for cost or risk on phones: volumetric light shafts, real-time reflections.
## Decisions and parked items (2026-10-06)
- Day-1 trough (pacing audit): not fixing income. A calm line at about minute 1.5 makes the quiet stretch feel intended. Wish rotation after a grant stays a parked proposal (changes income and the streak rule; re-run `scripts/pacing-curve.mjs` first).
- Story voice addresses the player in the masculine by default (`إنت`, `وانت غايب`, `فيك تصلّح`). Consistent and deliberate: leave as is; a gender-neutral pass would be a full copy rewrite.
- Late-game sink (proposal only, not built): after the door opens the only sink is a 12-button gift per night while income stays near 25 per minute. One small option for the owner: a "keepsake shelf" purchase, one new visitor keepsake per three nights at a rising price (30, 45, 60...), reusing the gift art path. It adds a sink without changing earning; measure with the pacing script before shipping.
- Low-detail governor: parked on branch `claude/game-audit-qa-batch9`; no PR until a real-device check shows the benefit and the one-time shader-recompile hitch is acceptable.
